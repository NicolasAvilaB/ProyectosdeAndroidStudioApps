### Bugs

To correctly submit a bug go through these steps:

 - Make sure that it's really a bug in Carbon, not in your code. To do that try to isolate the bug, create a very simple app with that bug and launch it on two or three different devices.
 - In 'Issues' section click 'Add Issue'.
 - Describe the issue you're experiencing.
 - Add steps to reproduce.
 - Add device and system info.
 - Add stacktrace.
 - Add a sample code used to reproduce the issue.

Of course not always you'll be able to get all of those information. Sometimes it's not necessary. In all other cases try to be precise and provide as much info as possible.

### Feature requests

If you think that Carbon lacks anything such library should have, you can open a feature request. To do that simply create a new issue and describe the thing you're thinking of. Then you have two options:

 - Wait. If the feature is reasonable, I will add it. It may take some time, be patient.
 - Make a pull request with your feature. Make sure that I'm ok with the feature, the code is clean, complete and bug-free.

Feature requests can be rejected in some cases:

 - The feature is very specific and solves only your problem.
 - The feature is impossible to be run on all platforms supported by Carbon.
 
 ### Wiki
 
 You may add and edit Wiki pages as well. When doing so, please make sure that:
 
  - Your page is consistent with the rest of the Wiki
  - The information you're adding is also useful to others
  - The information is up to date, precise and contain only facts
  - The language is appropriate and the grammar is correct
